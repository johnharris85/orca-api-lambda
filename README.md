# Whale Museum

> This is adapted from the original [Lambda Applied Javascript Sprint Challenge](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge-Applied-Javascript)
> to provide more examples / practise for students.

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored the DOM and the concept of components. During this Sprint, you studied the DOM, DOM Events, and Components, as well as HTTP GET requests, and the axios library.

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

* [ ] Look through the HTML code and familiarize yourself with the different sections. Some of them already exist, but some need to be filled in. DO NOT add any code to the HTML file itself.

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Header/index.js` file, create the Header component.

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Species/index.js` file, create individual species components.

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Sightings/index.js` file, create
  individual Sightings components.

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Average/index.js` file, create a
  component with the average sighting.

* [ ] If you have finished the above, research `data attributes`. Implement data attributes within your species as well as your sightings. Give the species functionality so that when they are clicked they filter the sightings to only display the sightings that contain that species.
